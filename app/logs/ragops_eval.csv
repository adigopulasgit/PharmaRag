2025-09-19T19:58:16.605497,"what is ic50 value
","**Disclaimer: This answer is NOT grounded in our dataset (LLM-only fallback).**  Answer:  The IC50 value is a measure of the effectiveness of a compound or drug in inhibiting the activity of a target protein. In biochemistry and pharmacology, it is used to quantify the concentration of an inhibitor that reduces the enzyme's activity by 50%. The IC50 value provides valuable information on the potency and selectivity of a molecule as a potential therapeutic agent. A lower IC50 value indicates greater potency, while a higher value suggests less effective inhibition.  General Notes:  - Keep in mind that this answer is not based on specific data or evidence from our dataset. - To refine your query or obtain more accurate information, please consider providing additional context or specifying the protein target, experimental conditions, and/or relevant biological pathways. - Consult additional sources, such as academic papers or reputable online resources, to deepen your understanding of IC5",3,25209,169,195,6731,10986,0.0,0,,1
2025-09-22T17:55:06.365819,Create a dataset with q15858,"Answer: CMPD-002 is likely to be suitable for further investigation as an EGFR inhibitor due to its moderate potency (IC50 = 12 nM) and lacks significant toxicity concerns.  Supporting Evidence: • BindingDB assay [assay_egfr_0001] shows CMPD-002 has a binding affinity of IC50 = 12 nM, indicating its potential as an EGFR inhibitor. • ClinTox risk category: LOW (score 0.18) suggests low toxicity risk for this compound, making it more suitable for further investigation.",4,21818,319,115,7999,6317,0.395,4,BindingDB assay [BDB:223344].
